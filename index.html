            <p style="text-align:center;"> Technology is rapidly improving, offering new innovations and revolutionary projects every year.
            There are innovations happening right now that are ripped straight from the pages of science-fiction. 
            Whether that is robots that can read minds, AI that can create images on their own, holograms, bionic 
            eyes, or other mind-blowing technology, there is a lot to expect from the world of future technology </p>

            <p style="text-align:right;">December 2, 2022 </p>
            
            <p style="text-align:center;"> Biomedical and electrical engineers have created a new method for measuring neural activity using 
                light – rather than electricity – which could result in a complete reimagining of medical technology like brain-machine interfaces 
                and nerve-operated prosthetics. </p>
